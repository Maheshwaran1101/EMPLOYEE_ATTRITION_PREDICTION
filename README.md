## Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes related to employee demographics, work-life balance, compensation, and training. Key features include:

- **Age**: Employee's age group
- **Work-Life Balance**: Measure of work-life balance (1 to 4)
- **Monthly Salary**: Employee's average monthly salary
- **Gender**: Employee's gender
- **Training Sessions**: Number of training sessions attended in the previous year
- **Job Level**: Entry-level, Mid-level, or Senior-level
- **Attrition**: Indicator of whether the employee left the organization

## Analysis and Insights

### Key Findings

1. **Age and Attrition**
   - Employees in the younger age group (26 to 35 years) are more prone to attrition.

2. **Work-Life Balance**
   - 65% of employees enjoy good work-life balance, while 35% experience poor work-life balance.

3. **Monthly Salary and Attrition**
   - The average monthly salary significantly impacts employee attrition, with departing employees earning an average of $4,787 compared to $6,833 for those who remain.
   - Gender-specific average monthly income does not affect attrition rates, as both male and female departing employees have similar salary ranges.

4. **Training and Attrition**
   - Entry-level employees who left the organization did not receive adequate training, with 97% receiving less than 5 training sessions in the previous year.

### Recommendations

1. **Targeted Retention for Younger Employees**
   - Implement mentorship programs and career development initiatives tailored to engage and retain employees within the 26 to 35 age group.
   - Invest in orientation programs and career development initiatives specifically tailored to entry-level staff to enhance their skills, job satisfaction, and retention.

2. **Work-Life Balance Initiatives**
   - Prioritize work-life balance initiatives to improve the well-being and retention of employees, especially those facing challenges in this area.

3. **Review Compensation Packages**
   - Ensure compensation and benefits packages are competitive in the market. Adjust salaries to align with industry standards to increase retention.
   - Focus on retention strategies unrelated to gender-specific compensation, such as career development opportunities and work environment improvements.

4. **Enhanced Training Programs**
   - Invest in orientation programs and career development initiatives specifically tailored to entry-level staff to enhance their skills, job satisfaction, and retention.
